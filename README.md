Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph using Priority Queue data structure in C. 
File "airports.dat" represents a graph with a list of nodes, each of which has a certain cost/weight. To test the algorithm, data is read from "airports.dat" file.
I also included airport_graph.jpg to visually show the graph and all nodes. In this test case, each node is an airport and the algorithm finds the least cost path from airport 0 (PDX) to all other airports.
